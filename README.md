ABOUT
=====
Class to access and talk to your TeamLab portal, using cURL and php.


IMPORTANT
=========
This script is not perfect in any ways, it is just a way I've managed to 
use the TeamLab API myself, so use it at your own risk! Feel free
to use the bug tracker.


Getting started
===============
1. Put demo.php and TeamLab.php on a web-server
2. Update demo.php to use your login information from your portal.
3. Open demo.php in your browser to test.
4. If everything works, you should get a dump of all users in your portal.
